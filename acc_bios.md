<img style="float:left; padding: 3px 3px 3px 3px;" width="123px" src="./images/JimMcCarthy.jpg"/>Jim McCarthy, co-author of <a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com/online/">The Core Protocols</a> and Software for Your Head.

Jim led the creation one of the great Microsoft teams, the Visual C++ team. Jim wrote Dynamics of Software Development from Microsoft Press (1995, 2006). His approach and observations formed the basis of Microsoft Solutions Framework and were a catalyst for and a progenitor of the Extreme and Agile programming movements. 
Jim partners with his wife, Michele McCarthy, to run McCarthy Technologies, Inc., which provides technology, training and consulting that enables organizations and teams to consistently generate the greatest possible results. The key to these results is an innovative, proprietary technology called "The Core". It encapsulates and makes accessible the best interpersonal collaboration technology currently available and has been thoroughly researched, tested, and applied over the past 15 years. Just as Jim's earlier approaches contributed to Microsoft's successful culture, and ultimately helped give rise to the XP and Agile movements, his current research into The Core is poised to help a new generation of organizations achieve their highest potential.<br clear="all" />

See more at the <a href="http://www.mccarthyshow.com">McCarthy Show</a>.

Beginning in 1990, Michele worked at Microsoft as a program manager on five projects, establishing a reputation for shipping on time. Jim McCarthy met Michele and encouraged her to move to the Visual C++ group where she began innovating in the area of team dynamics. While at Microsoft, Michele reached many of the insights that led she and Jim to leave Microsoft and create McCarthy Technologies, Inc. She is responsible for the development of many of the team formation concepts McCarthy Technologies practices and teaches today. 
Michele has brought her team efficiency skills to bear on the McCarthy BootCamps and the subsequent development of The Core Protocols. She is currently the primary instructor at McCarthy BootCamps around the world, the primary consultant to McCarthy Technologies' clients, and co-hosts The McCarthy Show podcast with Jim. Her passion is transforming groups of executives into true teams and advising high potential leaders.<br clear="all" />
