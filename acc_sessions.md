Project RAPPCulture: Illuminating Cultural Paradigms and Sparking Cultural Evolution
===================<img style="float:left; padding: 3px 3px 3px 3px;" width="123px" src="./images/OziomaEgwuonwu.png"/>Ozioma Egwuonwu, Columbia University & Head of <a href="http://burnbright-lifeworks.com/">BurnBright Lifeworks</a>
 
An organization’s culture is built on values, beliefs and basic assumptions that manifest themselves in the smallest of details. Companies like RAPP believe that an investment in the co-creation of agile culture with its employees inevitably creates an optimal work environment based on shared value.In October 2011, RAPP conducted a cultural experiment using a series of progressive techniques rooted in the transformational methodologies of Ozioma Egwuonwu, founder of BurnBright Lifeworks, Inc.  The aim of the RAPPCulture project was to diagnose the cultural paradigm of the agency, explore challenges to employee engagement, and spark a shift in organizational culture.As participants across 4 offices were guided through deeper states of cultural awareness, cultural dynamics were explored. The RAPPculture study continues to play a vital role in the evolution of company culture, as it yielded rich insights and instigated a strategy for tailored cultural change. This presentation will share the case study, research methods/design and key learnings for engaging employees in organizational transformation from the bottom up/inside out via the use of collaborative innovation & technology.
