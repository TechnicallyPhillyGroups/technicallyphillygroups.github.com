Technically Philly Groups (TPG) has partnered with the Agile NE Corridor, Agile Philly,  Agile Boston, and Agile Connecticut to run this event.  TPG's e-mail blasts reach thousands of Philadelphia-region technology professionals, and TPG alone has turned out over a hundred participants per month for the last year running at various events. This is the culmination of our outreach. Anyone who knows that the new wave of management requires better facilitation skills will appreciate this event!

SPONSORSHIP BENEFITS
==================

**Alignment**
We are a values-based learning organization. We don't want your money unless you can support the TPG [values](/values.html) of service, relationships, and learning before profit. This is a huge benefit to you, as attendees will know you're there to find out what would be of service to them, rather than to spam them. Our audiences tend to be highly receptive to service-oriented marketing (ask us about our cocktail-hour drink ticket incentive!).

**Expected Attendance:** 250 people, primarily IT managers, executives, and team members
