## Is your name "TPG" or "Technically Philly Groups"?

Officially, we're "Technically Philly Groups," but the bank will cash checks
written to "TPG," as well.

## What is the relationship between Technically Philly and TPG?

[Technically Philly][] has graciously allowed us to piggyback on their good
name. However, TPG is a completely separate entity. "Technically Philly Groups"
is the name of our Pennsylvania non-profit corporation; it is _not_ a
subsidiary or a related business unit of Technically Media, Inc., which runs
the Technically Philly web site.

## Are my contributions to TPG tax-deductible?

No. While Technically Philly Groups is a non-profit company, it is _not_ yet
a 501(c)(3). Most companies that give us money categorize the donation as
"Advertising and Promotion," rather than "Charitable Contribution."

## Who runs TPG?

[André Dhondt][] is the driving force behind the creation of TPG. However, many
others are involved in setting the group's direction and working behind the
scenes to make things happen.

## Is the City of Philadelphia officially involved?

<img width="180px" src="./images/msb.jpg" style="float:right;padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px;">
Yes. TPG has the attention of the Mayor's office. Through representatives
from the City, TPG has access to additional resources, including meeting
space in the City's Municipal Services Building.

## How can I or my group get involved?

See our [Contacts](/contact.html) page.

## How can TPG help my user group?

In various ways, including:

* **Facilities**. Through an agreement with the City of Philadelphia, TPG
  has access to rooms in the Municipal Services Building, at Broad and Arch
  Sts.
* **Equipment**. TPG has projectors to lend.
* **Food**. TPG member groups often meet at the same time, in the Municipal
  Services Building, in different rooms on the 16th floor. These joint meeting
  help to promote cross-pollination and networking. TPG sponsors generally
  take care of providing pizza and drinks for these meetings.
* **Promotion**. TPG can help promote your group to the wider technology
  audience in the Philadelphia area.

## What's the answer to life, the universe, and everything?

Why, 42. (Of course.)
