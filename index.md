Technically Philly Groups (TPG) is a Pennsylvania non-profit corporation,
dedicated to supporting the many  technology users groups in the Philadelphia
metropolitan area.

TPG is a *meta-group*, organized in 2011 to lighten the load of running our
user groups (by sharing venues and sponsors), to promote the cross-pollination
of ideas, and to extend our technical networks in the greater Philadelphia
region.

TPG has partnered with [Technically Philly][], in this effort. 
[Technically Philly][] maintains a [comprehensive calendar][] of technical
events in the Philly region, and participating [TPG groups][] are
listed on that calendar.

**Note:** Technically Philly Groups is a separate legal entity from Technically
Media, Inc., the company that runs [Technically Philly][].
