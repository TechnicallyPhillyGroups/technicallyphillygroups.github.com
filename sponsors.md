Technically Philly Groups (TPG) actively seeks corporate sponsorship, to help
us with our mission. We have two levels of sponsorship:


* **Annual Sponsor:** $500 minimum -- at the beginning of each Technically Philly Groups meeting for 1 year after we receive your donation, we'll acknowledge your company as an Annual Sponsor, link to you on our web site, and we'll read out a 30-word announcement for our audience on one date of your choice.

* **Sponsor-of-the-Month:** $250 minimum -- at the beginning of each Technically Philly Groups meeting for the month in which you'd like to apply your donation, we'll acknowledge your company as a sponsor and read out a 30-word announcement of your choice.

All sponsorship money goes directly toward TPG's mission. Your monetary support indicates that you agree to uphold the [TPG Values](/values.html) of service, relationships, and learning.

Mail checks payable to **TPG, Inc.**:
