LEARNING AND NETWORKING
================================
Only organizations that can adapt quickly to changing markets will remain competitive in today's marketplace. To help our members and sponsors adapt quickly, Technically Philly Groups (TPG) was founded--attracting the brightest, most connected, and most self-driven technology professionals in the Philadelphia region (the user group organizers). These are the people that are building the future--the people willing to give to the community and to be humble enough to learn everything they can. By working together, these organizers can leverage one another's gifts, thereby creating a learning organization--an organization that is highly capable of adapting to a changing market.

We expect Technically Philly Groups events to be a hub of innovation, communication, and learning. We know that by uniting together we'll help build a more common language for talking about technology, ideas will spread faster, and we'll be able to show what topics we value.


VALUES
======
A learning organization requires a high degree of trust; by joining TPG we commit to favor long-term learning and relationships--meaning we've all got to show up in the spirit of service.  Technically Philly Groups is founded on the following principles:
* **Service:** we all do better when we share what we've got. Sometimes all we have to share is curiosity; other ways we can serve are to: teach; sponsor food for an event; bring a friend to an event.  We believe in, and live by the principles of, a gift economy.
* **Relationships:** we care about the long-term sustainability; we seek win-win opportunities by getting to know one another well enough that we can treat others the way they'd like to be treated.
* **Learning:** the more we learn, apply what we learn, and validate that it's useful, the better we'll be at our jobs (whether we're in a start-up environment, academic institution, public service, or established business). The purpose of our meeting together is to learn from one another, and to accelerate our ability to deliver results in our software/technical environments. We also believe that learning is maximized when we're having fun--and joy at our events is closely tied to supporting autonomy, mastery, and purpose in the way we structure discussions.

WE DON'T JUST WANT YOUR TIME/MONEY
==================================
To make it painfully obvious, we don't want your time or money unless you can commit to these values. There are plenty of people building a New Culture of sustainability, fair trade, and gifts. All sponsors listed on this site have reviewed and agreed to put service, relationships and learning before profit. Money helps fuel our growth--but not at the expense of our values!
